# Physicochemical Wine Quality Analysis

## Project Description

This project focuses on performing an analysis of the physicochemical properties of red wine to predict its quality. The primary goal is to identify which physicochemical factors can accurately predict the quality of red wine. By exploring these predictions, we aim to gain insights into the relationship between various wine properties and wine quality.
